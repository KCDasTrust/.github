### Guidelines for contributing
- Always work on individual branches and not on main/master branch.
- Please create a pull request once you are done with you changes and would like to merge the code into master/main branches.
- Every pull request needs to be reviewed by atleast one other person before merging to main. Often times, there are checks set up to check if the code builds and run successfully. Please do not ignore these checks and only merge the code if the all checks pass.
- If you have not already enrolled as a srisevak, please do so at the earliest from the KCDT Gayatri mobile app or by reaching out to your Team Coordinator.
